## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [python] (https://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontPage) - is an object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language.

* [pathlib] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - This module offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems.

* [matplotlib] (https://matplotlib.org) - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

* [numpy] (https://numpy.org) - NumPy brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use. 

* [SQLAlchemy] (https://www.sqlalchemy.org) - SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

* [hvPlot] (https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - hvPlot provides an alternative for the static plotting API provided by Pandas and other libraries, with an interactive Bokeh-based plotting API that supports panning, zooming, hovering, and clickable/selectable legends.
